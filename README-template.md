### What I learned

I learn a lot by doing this challenge and i have a few question on this in submission page

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

I wanna deep dive into interactive styling in react and tailwindcss
